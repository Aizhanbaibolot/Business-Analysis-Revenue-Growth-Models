# Lariat-Car-Rental
## Project Overview <p>
The purpose of this  project is to minimize cost and maximize revenue of the company called **"Lariat"** that rents the Cars. Based on the requests of the employes 
we went through the following calculation steps:
* Strategy 1: Increase the number of cars
* Strategy 2: Assume growth in revenue of cars, number of cars remains same
* Strategy 3: Assume decrease of car cost and insurance cost to maximize net revenue
Based on the achieved results I have developed strategies which that can optimize and forecaste revenue for 2019.
