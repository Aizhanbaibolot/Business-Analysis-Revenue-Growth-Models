* Increase cost of the car rentals by 15%
* Costs remain same, gross revenue $60M, net revenue $26.5M, which makes difference of $8M.
* Strategy 3: Assume decrease of car cost and insurance cost to maximize net revenue
Based on the achieved results I have developed strategies which that can optimize and forecaste revenue for 2019.
